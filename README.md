Documentation and Reference of how to take care of a salt water pool

## Troubleshooting

| problem| cause | solution| 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| White scaling on side of walls | PH too high, calcium carbonate building up| Clean salt cell, avoid shock with calcium | 
| Gree Algee | | Shock with Dichlor Shock or Liquid Chlorine (not the same as the weekly shock)|


## Procedures

### [- Inspect / Clean salt cell](/procedures/inspect%20salt%20cell.md)



## Checklists

### - [Weekly](/checklists/weekly.md)
### - [Monthly](/checklists/monthly.md)
### - [Quarterly](/checklists/quarterly.md)
### - [After Rainfall / Freshwater](/checklists/rainfall.md)


# Tests

Ideals for 20,000 gallon salt pool

| Ideal | 20,000 | 
| --- | --- | 
| PH | `< 7.6 PH` | 
| Free Chlorine | `3 PPM` | 
| Calcium Hardness | `200-400 PPM`| 

### Free Chlorine (weekly)

- Ideal `3 PPM`

### PH (weekly)

- Keep below `7.6` to protect skin and parts
- Above `7.8` requires chemical intervention
- Muriatic Acid or PH minus 
- Salt Generator increasers PH, decrease salt generation run time if too high

### Salinity (monthly / rain / fresh water fill up)

- Test differnt areas of pool

### Alkalinity, Cyanuric Acid ( CYA), Calcium Hardness (monthly)

- **Total Alkalinity** acts as buffer for PH fluxuations (less of a impact on salt systems)

- **Cyanuric Acid/CYA** (Stablizier) prevents UV light from breaking down chlorine

- **Calcium Hardness** Hard water can damage pool equipment, Use hose filter when refilling pool



### Shock/Boost (weekly/rainstorms)


- Add non-chlorine shock (do not use dichlor shock or liquid chlorine )
- If salt cell has 'boost' or 'superchlorinate' setting, run that once a week
